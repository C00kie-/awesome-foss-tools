                        \begin{itemize}
                \item It works
                \item and many open source rules and practices apply
                \item What did we learn? and help your next open source security project
                        \end{itemize}

        \item While designing and building face-masks, people took back the control of the tools by becoming producers
        \item They use the {\bf most easy and accessible tools} (not always open source) to provide guidelines

        \item Social pressure can help in such period
        \item Many projects during the lock-down relied on {\bf existing open source, free software and content licensing schemes}
        \item A lot of cloth face mask designers didn't know they were doing open source

        \begin{itemize}
                \item Fun is important but the gift aspect is a strong community cement
                \item Sharing common tools and objectives to create values
                \item Create knowledge via open source projects as a medium
                \item {\bf Reciprocity to support self-management of open source communities}
                \item Diverse contributors and contribution ensure project stability

        \frametitle{Thank You}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\bf Markdown} format and all the open source rendering implementations
                \item {\bf Inkscape} (to make cool logos for open source project)
                \item {\bf git} (even if the handling of binary files is still hard)
                \item {\bf BBB BigBlueButton} and {\bf Jitsi} (diversity is good when one fails)
                \item {\bf Python} (for extracting large table of filtering tests only available in crappy PDF generated from an unpublished XLS file)
                \item {\bf SciHub} (thanks Alexandra) as it was the only way to download the academic papers about the filtering of textile fabrics
                \item {\bf All the people who did face masks} and didn't know they were part of the open source and maker community

        \frametitle{Where We Succeeded}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item The {\bf open source and maker communities resonated} during the crisis with a lot of initiatives
                \item The past 20+ years of open source licensing did help a lot (less friction in exchange)
                \item Git repositories supported the coordination effort on contributions and content publishing
        \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
        \frametitle{Where We Failed}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Some open source tools are still {\bf too complex} to use compared of the sharing of a YouTube video
                \item We are still bad at indexing, evaluating, coordinating and archiving projects (how many face mask designs on GitHub?)
                \item Release early, release often. We failed there as early was a matter of days and not weeks
                \item {\bf Opportunity for new open source projects} such as markdown notes taking and video screenshot at the same time
        \end{itemize}
